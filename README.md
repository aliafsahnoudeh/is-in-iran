# is-in-iran

A lightweight Python library that checks whether a given geographic point  
(latitude, longitude) lies inside the borders of **Iran**.

It loads an official MultiPolygon GeoJSON of Iran and performs a  
point-in-polygon check using **Shapely**.

---

## 🚀 Installation

pip install is-in-iran
```
